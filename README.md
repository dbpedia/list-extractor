# list-extractor - Extract Data from Wikipedia Lists

WikiParser takes a language and a wiki-page (for now: english and List_of_works_of_William_Gibson)
and parses its json format returned from a call to JSONpedia web service.
The result is a dictionary containing section titles as keys and corresponding lists as values.
